# Design Review

Use before merging UI changes.

## Mandatory checks
- Visual hierarchy and spacing consistency.
- Mobile touch target and readability.
- WCAG 2.2 AA contrast baseline.
- Interaction state completeness (default/hover/active/disabled/loading/error).
- No clipping/overlap on key breakpoints.

## Output
Use `.agents/templates/handoff.md` and include screenshot references.
