- id: OPS-PILOT-001
- lane: standard

  - AGENTS.md
  - .github/**
- non-goals:
  - No product feature changes
  - No API behavior changes
- assumptions:
  - Branch protection and required checks will be configured in GitHub by owner
- clarification-questions:
  - Should CODEOWNERS use personal handle only or team aliases in phase 2?
- approval-status: approved
- approval-note: User approved implementing steps 2-4 and verification in this branch.
- done-criteria:
  - CODEOWNERS added
  - CI quality gate workflow added
  - lane detect + quality-gate scripts validated locally
- verification:
  - .agents/scripts/detect-lane.sh
  - .agents/scripts/run-quality-gate.sh standard
- risks:
  - CI runtime may increase on multi lane due to cf-build
