- summary: Implemented ko/en i18n with locale-prefix routes, middleware-based locale redirect, language switcher, translated target page copy, and localized map/card/status strings.
- validations:
  - npx tsc --noEmit (pass)
  - npm run build (pass)
  - npm run cf:build (pass)
  - npm run test:e2e (11 pass, 1 skipped mobile-only counterpart)
- residual-risks:
  - Language switcher currently preserves query string; if new query-driven pages are added, verify switching behavior per page.
