- summary: Implemented locale SSG prerender strategy with `generateStaticParams` and `dynamicParams=false`, converted legacy non-locale routes to static redirects, split client implementations from legacy route files, and documented Cloudflare/OpenNext rendering decisions and SEO indexing checks.
- validations:
  - .agents/scripts/run-quality-gate.sh multi (pass: tsc/build/cf:build)
  - npm run test:e2e (manual run, pass: 31 passed, 1 skipped)
  - build route classification verified: locale routes now `● (SSG)`
  - manual check: `/en/onboarding` title/h1 present for normal UA and Googlebot UA
- residual-risks:
  - `.agents/scripts/run-quality-gate.sh` currently fails to auto-detect `test:e2e` script; e2e required manual execution in this run.
  - ISR/revalidate is intentionally not introduced in P0; cache-backed revalidation strategy remains P1 scope.
