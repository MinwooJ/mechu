[Ticket]
- id: seo-search-console-p0
- lane: multi
- owner-agent: orchestrator
- goal: Implement SEO P0 (canonical/hreflang, sitemap, robots) and Search Console operational runbook for global locales.
- editable-paths:
  - app/[locale]/**
  - app/sitemap.ts
  - app/robots.ts
  - lib/seo/**
  - docs/**
  - README.md
  - .agents/**
- non-goals:
  - Google Ads setup
  - Recommendation/map feature changes
  - Automated Search Console UI actions
- assumptions:
  - Canonical base URL is controlled by `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`
  - Until final domain confirmation, fallback base URL is `https://mechu.app`
- clarification-questions:
  - Confirm final production canonical domain (`mechu.app` vs `www.mechu.app`)
  - Confirm whether `/status` should stay indexable
- approval-status: approved
- approval-note: User asked to execute `.agents/requests/seo_search_console_request.md` with multi-agent workflow.
- done-criteria:
  - Locale pages emit canonical + hreflang alternates consistently
  - `robots.txt` disallows API crawling and exposes sitemap
  - `sitemap.xml` includes locale URLs and alternates
  - Search Console docs/checklist added for operator handoff
- verification:
  - npx tsc --noEmit
  - npm run build
  - npm run cf:build
  - npm run test:e2e
- risks:
  - Search Console submission and ownership verification remain manual operator tasks.
