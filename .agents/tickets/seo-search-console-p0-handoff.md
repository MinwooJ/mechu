- summary: Added locale-aware canonical/hreflang metadata, generated robots and sitemap routes, and documented Search Console setup/monitoring runbook for global launch.
- validations:
  - npx tsc --noEmit (pass)
  - npm run build (pass)
  - npm run cf:build (pass)
  - npm run test:e2e (21 pass, 1 skipped)
  - manual check: `/ko/onboarding`, `/en/results` meta tags include canonical + alternates
  - manual check: `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml` output verified
- residual-risks:
  - Domain property creation, DNS TXT verification, sitemap submission, and URL inspection remain manual operations in Search Console.
  - Canonical base URL uses fallback `https://mechu.app` when `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is unset; production env must define final domain explicitly.
