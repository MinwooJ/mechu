[Ticket]
- id: prerender-rendering-p0
- lane: multi
- owner-agent: orchestrator
- goal: Establish and implement production-ready prerender/rendering strategy for locale routes on Next.js App Router + OpenNext Cloudflare while preserving map/recommendation behavior.
- editable-paths:
  - app/**
  - lib/i18n/**
  - docs/**
  - .agents/**
- non-goals:
  - Recommendation algorithm changes
  - Map provider behavior changes
  - UI redesign beyond rendering/SEO-safe fallback states
  - Ads setup
- assumptions:
  - Locale scope is fixed to `ko`, `en`, `ja`, `zh-Hant`
  - Legacy non-locale routes remain compatibility entrypoints (redirected)
  - `status` route remains noindex
- clarification-questions:
  - None (request doc fixed scope and user requested direct execution)
- approval-status: approved
- approval-note: User explicitly requested execution from `.agents/requests/prerender_rendering_request.md` with multi-agent workflow.
- done-criteria:
  - Static-eligible routes are explicitly defined and implemented
  - Locale prerender strategy is documented with platform constraints (OpenNext/Cloudflare)
  - Indexing quality checks for loading/error states are documented and reflected in route behavior
  - `docs/todo-global-launch.md` P0 prerender items are updated
- verification:
  - .agents/scripts/run-quality-gate.sh multi
- risks:
  - OpenNext Cloudflare revalidation/caching behavior may vary by deployment configuration; strategy must avoid unsupported ISR assumptions.
