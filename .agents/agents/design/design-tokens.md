# Design Token Baseline

- Primary: `#f48c25`
- Primary accent: `#ffb25f`
- Dark background family remains default for MECHU
- Keep a single source of truth in CSS variables before adding new tones

## Rules
- Do not add one-off colors without token registration.
- Keep spacing scale consistent across onboarding/preferences/results.
- Keep border radius and shadow style coherent by component family.
